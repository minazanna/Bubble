# Bubble
EC327 Android App

## Description:
Bubble is designed to help up-and-coming music artists gain exposure. Bubble is structurally similar to applications such as Tinder and Bumble. In these matchmaking applications, users swipe through brief profiles of other users. They have the option to “like” users. Users also have a user profile and can access other user profiles. Bubble follows the same structure; however, instead of potential suitors, music artists can post snippets (short clips) of their songs. Listeners can swipe through the songs and like or dislike them. They also have access to the songs that they have liked and they can visit the artist’s profile and the song’s profile. 

## Motivation:
We made this application for a software engineering course's final project.

## Prerequisites:
- Working Android Studio environment
- Working Android-compatible phone emulator (Pixel 2, API 28, x86, Android 9.0 with Google Play was used)
- In order to access our Firebase Firestore you will need to send milanp@bu.edu your SHA-1 key for the project (instructorions for finding your SHA-1 key can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39144629/how-to-add-sha-1-to-android-application ). Once you email him the authentication key he can add you to the Firebase project.
